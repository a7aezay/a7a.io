#My Job is a Craft

I see my work as a craft instead of a job...I craft that I get paid for,
qualities of my craft are (1) Reliability (2) Scalability and (3)
Maintainability.

Just learning about each of these qualities took lots of time to study, trials
that failed, and of course fires.

I am no were near perfect in that, but it is not about perfectionism. it is
more about style...you have your style that you keep adding and  qualities to,
and enhance them as you learn, this is why it is a craft, I can keep getting
better at it til my last day...
