      <p class='tweet-it'>
Bill Hicks used to end his shows with this...Life is like a ride in an
amusement park. And when you choose to go on it you think it's real because
that's how powerful our minds are.  And the ride goes up and down and round and
round. It has thrills and chills and it's very brightly colored and it's very
loud and it's fun, for a while. Some people have been on the ride for a long
time and they begin to question: "Is this real, or is this just a ride?" And
other people have remembered, and they come back to us, they say: "Hey, don't
worry, don't be afraid, ever, because this is just a ride." ... and we kill
those people.
      </p>

Ha ha, "Shut him up. We have a lot invested in this ride. Shut him up. Look at
my furrows of worry. Look at my big bank account and my family. This just has
to be real." It's just a ride. But we always kill those good guys who try and
tell us that, you ever notice that? And let the demons run amok. But it doesn't
matter, because it's just a ride. And we can change it anytime we want. It's
only a choice. No effort, no work, no job, no savings and money. A choice,
right now, between fear and love. The eyes of fear want you to put bigger locks
on your doors, buy guns, close yourself off. The eyes of love instead see all
of us as ONE.
      </p>

Here's what we can do to change the world, right now, to a better ride. Take
all that money we spend on weapons and defense each year, and instead spend it
feeding, clothing and educating the poor of the world, which it would many
times over, not one human being excluded, and we can explore space together,
both inner and outer, forever, in peace.

      <p class='tweet-it'>
I see my work as a craft instead of a job...I craft that I get paid for,
qualities of my craft are (1) Reliability (2) Scalability and (3)
Maintainability.
      </p>

      <p class='tweet-it'>
Just learning about each of these qualities took lots of time to study, trials
that failed, and of course fires.
      </p>

      <p class='tweet-it'>
I am no were near perfect in that, but it is not about perfectionism. it is
more about style...you have your style that you keep adding and  qualities to,
and enhance them as you learn, this is why it is a craft, I can keep getting
better at it til my last day...
