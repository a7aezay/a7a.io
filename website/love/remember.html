      <p><3 You are a strong, smart and independent woman. You have a long consistent record that make this statement a truthful fact.</p>

<p><3 Love, care, and be gentle with youself. You are your best, if not only, guardian.</p>

<p><3 Enjoy doing nothing when you can. And when you can't, enjoy what you are doing.</p>

<p><3 Select what to worry about. If it is not urgent and important, then do not worry about it.</p>

<p><3 Breath…….........deeply…...and…...slowly…….........feel your head on top of your shoulders…….........feel your back as a straight line between your head to your tail bone…….........feel your arms and legs……......... have them in a comfortable position…….........then realize the environment around you and feel how you are connected to it…….........say to yourself, I am enough to be happy, all I need is ME.</p>

<p><3 You look pretty and sexy as hell.</p>

<p><3 I love you</p>
